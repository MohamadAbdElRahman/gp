            <h2>What is &#8220;AUCTION&#8221; ?</h2>
            <p>An auction is a way to sell products within a specified period 
              in a specific location and geographical area in which people are 
              present to participate in the auction. It is a method of buying / selling 
              products through public negotiations to 
              determine the real market value of the product at that time, or we can say 
              it is a sales event where potential buyers make competitive offers on products auctions.</p>
    
            <p>The auction makes it competitive between customers to buy products, which makes it more enthusiastic and brings great benefit to sellers. It allows us to display this commodity and make people estimate its purchase price and rush to buy, which increases the possibility of selling it at a price more than the estimated price. </p>

            <h2>What is ONLINE AUCION ?</h2>
            <p>In contrast to the public auction, which requires the presence of the person or his representative in reality in a specific place and time, online auction applications can be participated in from anywhere around the world, and anyone can start an auction and sell a product from his place without the need to gather people in a unified place. It allows us to participate in auctions via the Internet from wherever place we are in at the appointed time for bidding, so it helps us to overcome geographical restrictions.</p>

            <h2>Why to use our ONLINE&nbsp;AUCTION website ?</h2>
            <p>We developed an online auction application adding some AI methods in order to facilitate 
              the sale of products at the best possible price and to make it competitive between buyers 
              in a specific period of time until they obtain the product from their places.</p>
    
            <p>The website will allow the users to access the auctions using an online portal using any 
              type of electronic devices which means overcoming the geographical obstacles. The users 
              can start their own auctions for free and sell whatever they want. There is no schedule 
              constraint that means bidder can bid anytime and from anywhere. The system enables the 
              user to participate in the auction to buy products. The bidding can be made on a global 
              level, so that there will be a lot of people who can join and participate in the auction</p>

              <p>We use decision-making tools that help the user purchase the best product that suits him, 
                through a recommendation system that recommends suitable products to the user that he 
                may like, and also through customer ratings of the product and the seller. Our 
                recommendation system will recommend products to the user depending on his previous 
                search results and depending on the feedback given to the products.</p>

                <p>Buying / selling through our app provides you with the necessary security means through 
                  contracts between seller , buyer , and supplier. No one will know about this contract 
                  except the customer, seller, and the supplier. The system provides complete privacy in 
                  terms of your data. </p>

              <p>Our system also helps solve the problem of unemployment and provides work for people, 
                as our system allows the user to create an account as a supplier which allows him to 
                freelance with us as a delivery agent using his own transportation vehicle. The supplier 
                receives offers to deliver orders, and he can reject or accept the offer. Upon acceptance 
                of the offer, a contract is signed between him and the seller and the buyer using their 
                digital signature.
